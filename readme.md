# The Jewish Community Must Recognize Palestinian Suffering


“*Behold how good and pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity.*” - Psalm 133

On December 7th — two months after Hamas killed [1,200 Israelis](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/12/world/middleeast/israel-death-toll-hamas-attack.html) and the Israeli government began a campaign that has [so far killed well over 25,000 Gazans](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/death-toll-israeli-strikes-gaza-passes-25000-gaza-health-officials-say-2024-01-21/) — the Jewish Federation of Cleveland sent out an email with the subject line “Bringing Light.”

The [email](https://www.jewishcleveland.org/news/blog/bringing_light/) suggests praying for a different group each night of Hanukkah. Among these groups are the victims of Oct. 7th, hostages being held by Hamas, and the Israeli Defense Forces; there is even a perfunctory nod toward Gazans who, having "resist[ed] Hamas' oppression," seem to have earned their humanity. Conspicuously absent, however, is any mention of the 25,000 people killed by the IDF in Gaza, along with more than 62,000 wounded and over 6,000 missing people. The Federation claims to represent Cleveland's Jewish community, but we are not a monolith. For many of us, this message reads like someone watering the lawn of a burning house. Now more than ever, we must lead and join difficult conversations. Now more than ever, we must do better — as Clevelanders, as Americans, and above all, as Jews.

Many Jews speaking out about Israel’s actions against Palestinians have been asked if we support Hamas. As Jews, this question is absurd. The idea that one must either support Hamas’ crimes against humanity or the Israeli government’s crimes against humanity is eroding our communal ethics. We have stepped so far from basic morality that even acknowledging the humanity of Palestinians is seen as treasonous or antisemitic. Our whole lives, we were taught the Jewish value of *pikuach nefesh*: every life is sacred. Now, we see a large portion of the Jewish community — including the leaders and institutions who raised us — enthusiastically say: "But not those ones." 

We have been appalled by the dehumanization our fellow Jews have directed toward Palestinians. Make no mistake: at the end of this war, there will be no winners. Every single Hamas militant could be killed, every hostage rescued, and we will all still lose. People do not forget the sight of their lifeless family members strewn across streets and crushed under buildings. Every parent who loses a child, every child who loses a sibling, and every child who loses a parent will hate the State of Israel. The reckless and murderous bombing campaign that Israel is currently carrying out will reverberate through generations of Palestinians and, in turn, Jews. This is not the *L’dor V’dor* that we sing into being. The images coming out of Gaza paint a vivid picture of human suffering. At first glance, these scenes may seem beyond our comprehension — but to our ancestors, they would look all too familiar. We must not forget this suffering just because its face has changed.

Right now, many Jews feel abandoned by our institutions, families, and leaders. Those of us who have been taught to raise our voices for justice and peace have been silenced, called “tokens,” “self-hating Jews,” or even *kapos* by members of our own community — all for insisting, as Jews have for generations, that people of all backgrounds are worth protecting. For this Jewish value, we have faced deeply offensive attempts at “un-jewing,” even from organizations that have long prided themselves on pluralism. It is worth remembering that antisemites do not care what our political views are: a Jew is a Jew is a Jew. We reject antisemitism while standing in solidarity with our Palestinian cousins. We, too, have felt their pain.

As Jews, we recognize our suffering through memorials, education, liturgy, outreach, tradition, and generational trauma. Many of us also recognize the suffering of others as part of our commitment to *Tikkun Olam*. But for too many mainstream Jewish organizations, this recognition stops with Palestinians. We call on our community to show the same attention to Palestinians’ pain, losses, and hardship. We must move beyond the narrative of "Either/Or" to one of "Both/And" — a narrative that recognizes the suffering that has long occurred at the hands of the Israeli government, even as many Jews have found solace in its theoretical promise of security.

If we are unable to condemn the indiscriminate killing of over 25,000 people and forced displacement of almost two million others, then we have failed to learn from the genocides, massacres, and forced migrations that we ourselves have endured, including the Shoah. We have allied ourselves with warmongering ethnonationalists, instead of attempting to reconcile the painful histories of Israeli politics. So far, American Jewish organizations have proven unwilling to disrupt the hegemony of these demagogues’ narratives and recognize how they endanger Jews in Israel and the diaspora alike. This willful blindness must end for Jews and Palestinians to achieve long-term safety.

A subset of the Jewish people, along with the British government, chose to intertwine our fate with the Palestinians’ more than a century ago. As a result, we must recognize the devastating price Palestinians have paid for the establishment of the State of Israel, as painful and difficult as that may be. We reject the false dichotomy between Jewish safety and Palestinian freedom. Indeed, there is only one way we can each achieve liberation: together.

In that spirit, we call on our Israeli and Palestinian cousins to join us in paving a path forward. We call on Hamas to release all remaining hostages. We call on Israel to free prisoners held without trial and to immediately stop its brutal attacks in Gaza. We call on our representative organizations to end dehumanizing campaigns against Palestinians. We call on our leaders to demand a bilateral ceasefire and to help work toward a lasting peace with dignity, justice, and equality for all.

We hope that the Federation will recognize its potential to promote peace by publicly supporting these actions. As Jews, we can and will debate our politics. But we must continue to uphold the sanctity of life — no exceptions. To those of you who share our concerns, we urge you to join the thousands of Jews across the country telling our leaders and families in one resounding voice: “Not in our name.”
